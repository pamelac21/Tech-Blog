# Tech Blog


## Description

 I want to build a CMS-style blog site similar to a Wordpress site, where developers can publish their blog posts and comment on other developersâ€™ posts as well. I will follow the MVC paradigm in its architectural structure, using Handlebars.js as the templating language, Sequelize as the ORM, and the express-session npm package for authentication.

![screencapture-secure-sands-16724-herokuapp-2022-02-26-18_02_17](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/87335354/155862809-9446de3b-5581-4b3c-b4e5-84fb3db1c4ff.jpg)

## Installation
<br />Clone the repo  <br />

<br />Use npm install to install dependecies. <br />
  `npm install` <br />
<br />Log into MySQL. <br />
  `mysql -u <user> -p ` <br />
Enter password. <br />
<br />Source the schema. <br />
  `source db/schema.sql` <br />
<br />Quit MySQL and seed the database.  <br />
  `quit
  node seeds`  <br />
<br />Start the server. <br />
  `npm start`

## Usage
```md
Once the server is started, visit localhost:3001. Users can sign up and log in. 
Once logged in, they will have two new options in the navigation bar. `dashboard` will take them to a page where they can create a new post, view previous posts (which they can select to edit or delete), or they can select `logout` . If they do not wish to make a post they can visit other users posts by either clicking on the title or comments. 
Here the user can see all the comments for this post and they can leave one of their own. If the user wishes to return to the homepage they can click on 'Tech POST' to take them back to the home page.
```
